Load the necessary libraries

```{r libraries, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, warning=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(car)       #for regression diagnostics
library(broom)     #for tidy output
library(ggfortify) #for model diagnostics
library(sjPlot)    #for outputs
library(knitr)     #for kable

```

# Scenario

Here is an example from @Fowler-1998-1998. An agriculturalist was interested in the effects of fertilizer load on the yield of grass.  Grass seed was sown uniformly over an area and different quantities of commercial fertilizer were applied to each of ten 1 m<sup>2</sup> randomly located plots.  Two months later the grass from each plot was harvested, dried and weighed.  The data are in the file **fertilizer.csv** in the **data** folder.

![](../resources/turf.jpg){width=70%}

| FERTILIZER   | YIELD   |
| ------------ | ------- |
| 25           | 84      |
| 50           | 80      |
| 75           | 90      |
| 100          | 154     |
| 125          | 148     |
| \...         | \...    |

---------------- ---------------------------------------------------
**FERTILIZER**:  Mass of fertilizer (g.m^-2^) - Predictor variable
**YIELD**:       Yield of grass (g.m^-2^) - Response variable
---------------- ---------------------------------------------------
 
 
The aim of the analysis is to investigate the relationship between fertilizer concentration and grass yield.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
fert = read_csv('../data/fertilizer.csv', trim_ws=TRUE) # trim_ws is the same as strip.white when you use read.csv
glimpse(fert)
head(fert)
str(fert)
```

# Exploratory data analysis - get a sense for what the data is saying & how likely assumptions are to be met etc. 

Model formula: we're going to assume normality and see how that goes
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i
$$
Let's make a scatter plot of yield vs. fertilizer to see what the data looks like
```{r scatter plot}
# is it approximately linear and the mean & variance relatively constant?
ggplot(fert,aes(x=FERTILIZER,y=YIELD))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm')+ # apply a linear model 
  theme_classic() # this looks pretty linear & looks like the variance is pretty even
```
```{r box plot}
# is the data approximealty normally dsitributed??
ggplot(fert,aes(y=YIELD))+
  geom_boxplot() # yep this looks relatively normally distributed
```

```{r violin plot}
# violin plot is good to show density
ggplot(fert,aes(y=YIELD,x=1))+
  geom_violin()
```

# Fit the model
```{r fit the model}
fert.lm <- lm(YIELD~1+FERTILIZER,data=fert) # manually specify intercept
fert.lm <- lm(YIELD~FERTILIZER,data=fert) # but R will automatically put an intercept in for us so we don't need the '1+' bit

attributes(fert.lm) # this tells you what is inside the list (fert.lm is a list object)
print(fert.lm$coefficients) # print to screen specific attributes of fert.lm

# Helper functions
coef(fert.lm) # this does the same thing as fert.lm$coefficients - different satistical routines might store the coefficients in different ways so using the coef() function searches for the coefficients regardless of how they're stored - can be more useful
summary(fert.lm) 
```

# Model validation
```{r run autoplot to suss out what's going on}
# test assumptions of the model

autoplot(fert.lm,which=1:6,ncol=2,label.size=3) # gives you a set of standarad diagnostic plots

# residuals vs. fitted - 

# standardises the residuals - useful for other models

# Cook's distance - influence of outliers - 
# leverage - how much of a outlier along the x axis
# residual: - how much of an outlier along the y axis
# Cook's distance - a measure of a point's overall influence based on residual & leverage - anything more than 0.8 is considered overly influential (the scale is standardised) - Cook's distance is a combination of residuals & leverage - if you have an issue with Cook's distance - look at residual vs. leverage plot to see whether the outlier is more along the x axis or the y axis - if Cook's distance if fine then the Residual's vs. leverage and Cook's Distance vs. leverage plots aren't going to tell you much more 

# if you need to see the specific Coook's distnace values then:
influence.measures(fert.lm) # cook's distance = cook.d, leverage = hat, inf - puts a star next to most extreme values
```

```{r}
plot_grid(plot_model(fert.lm, type='diag'))
# first plot is Q-Q normal plot
# bottom plot is residual plot
# right hand plot shows a dsitribution of your data
```
```{r base graphics effects plot}
# plotting the trends that the model has estimated - effects plot aka partial plot
plot(allEffects(fert.lm,residuals=TRUE)) # needs to know what model to plot, residuals part is how to put the points on the graph, blue line represents line of best fit, pink line is a smoother through the observed data

# here we have a positive slope, roughly what the intercept is, & the range of predicted values is sensible - get a sense that the model is a reasonably good model

# this is using base graphics - we can also use ggplot to do this
```
```{r ggplot effects plot}
# use ggplot to create effects plot - plot_model can make lots of different types of plots - see help for more info
plot_model(fert.lm,type='eff', show.data=TRUE)
```
 

# Model investigation / hypothesis testing
```{r}
# summary
# want to estimate effect  size, want to estimate the response in yield relative to fertiliser input - this is the slope: 0.81139
# standard error: 0.08367
# the way you interpret a p value is it's either less than 0.05 or it's not! that's it! interpret as a binomial thing - magnitude of p value is a reflection of sample size and not much else - not a reflection of effect size 
# R squared value - measure of the strength of the relationships between the two variables
summary(fert.lm)

# note on centering data: if we had centred our data, the slope wouldn't change - the y intercept would change - the y intercept becomes the mean if we centre our data - this is just one reason to centre the data - centering data can make the maths a lot easier - same with scaling the data 
```
```{r confidence intervals for significance}
# the alternative to using the p-value (since these are misused a lot) are confidence intervals
confint(fert.lm) # this gives you 95% confidence intervals
# can talk about significance using confidence intervale - if the interval includes zero, then not significant - if interval doesn't include zero then it is significant - confidence intervals gives you an indication of the variability of the effect size - more useful than p value
```

```{r tidy}
# tidy give you as consistent an output from any model as it can - because statistical models can vary in their outputs
tidy(fert.lm, conf.int = TRUE) # useful for putting in tables etc. 

fert.lm %>% 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() # this is helpful for formatting - outputs it as a table
```

# Predictions
how to make predictions in R ( i.e. substituting lots and lots of possible values into our model)
```{r making predictions}
# we could do this all by hand byt first creating a model matrix
newdata <- data.frame(FERTILIZER=110)
Xmat <- model.matrix(~FERTILIZER,data=newdata)
# now just need to do the inner product between new data & coefficients
coef(fert.lm)%*%t(Xmat) #need to transpose Xmat so matrix mulitplication works
# this give us our predicted value

# what about some more predictions?
newdata2 <- data.frame(FERTILIZER=110:120)
Xmat2 <- model.matrix(~FERTILIZER,data=newdata2)
coef(fert.lm)%*%t(Xmat2)

# R has a function that does all this for us:
emmeans(fert.lm,~FERTILIZER,at=newdata2) # what variable do you want to do the predictions for? - FERTILIZER, what data are 
# this gives you predicted values, standard error, and confidence intervals
```
# Summary figures
```{r}
# now let's choose a bigger range of values, capture the results & turn it into a graph!

fert_grid <- fert %>%  data_grid(FERTILIZER=seq_range(FERTILIZER, n=100)) # create a sequence of numbers over a range of values - we want 100 values in our sequence 

# now create predictions from the sequence of numbers we created above using out linear model
newdata <- emmeans(fert.lm,~FERTILIZER,at=fert_grid) %>% 
  as.data.frame   # this bit at the end tells it to turn the tibble it created into a data frame

# plot just the line of best fit & the raw data

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=fert,aes(y=YIELD,x=FERTILIZER))+
  geom_line(data=newdata,aes(y=emmean,x=FERTILIZER))+
  geom_ribbon(data=newdata,aes(ymin=lower.CL,ymax=upper.CL,x=FERTILIZER),alpha=0.3) # alpha makes the ribbon more or less transparent

ggplot(data=newdata,aes(x=FERTILIZER))+
  geom_point(data=fert,aes(y=YIELD,x=FERTILIZER))+
  geom_line(aes(y=emmean))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower.CL,ymax=upper.CL,x=FERTILIZER),alpha=0.3)+
  theme_classic()+
  scale_y_continuous(expression(Grass~yield~(g/m^-3)))+
  scale_x_continuous(expression(Fertilizer~concentration~(g/ml^-1)))
```

# References
The example Rmd files have code showing how to do different things with graphs
e.g. fig.cap() gives you a figure caption but there's some tricks involved so look through the R markdown Example4.Rmd (saved under resources > Rmarkdown-examples)
same applies to tables

# Citations
Should definitely cite the R packages that you use in your analysis 
type in citation() to get the correct citation for the R package you're using - specify what version of R
e.g. citation(package='lme4')
only cite the packages you use for the actual analysis - don't worry about the packages you use for graphing etc. for example

# RE making R markdowns put sessionInfo() in the last chunk - this tells you what packages you used, what version you were using etc. etc. - good habit to get into 
```{r session information}
sessionInfo()
```
