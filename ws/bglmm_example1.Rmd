# Scenario

A plant pathologist wanted to examine the effects of two different strengths of tobacco virus on the number of lesions on tobacco leaves.  She knew from pilot studies that leaves were inherently very variable in response to the virus.  In an attempt to account for this leaf to leaf variability, both treatments were applied to each leaf.  Eight individual leaves were divided in half, with half of each leaf inoculated with weak strength virus and the other half inoculated with strong virus.  So the leaves were blocks and each treatment was represented once in each block.  A completely randomised design would have had 16 leaves, with 8 whole leaves randomly allocated to each treatment.

------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**LEAF**     The blocking factor - Factor B
**TREAT**    Categorical representation of the strength of the tobacco virus - main factor of interest Factor A
**NUMBER**   Number of lesions on that part of the tobacco leaf - response variable

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
tobacco = read_csv('../data/tobacco.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(tobacco)
tobacco <- tobacco %>% mutate(LEAF=factor(LEAF),TREATMENT=factor(TREATMENT))
# blocking design - each leaf is a block, each leaf gets both treatments
# in frequentist  the block is random factor, the treatment is a fixed factor
# in bayesian, all effects are considered random, instead the leaf would be considered a varying effect

# so removal, control (the treatment) are fixed effects, the plots are random effects - response is benthic community composition, recruitment, algae canopy height, number of holdfasts, sediment deposition etc. etc.??
# each treatment is applied to each block/leaf - configuration is randomised
```


# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i =\boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i} + \boldsymbol{\gamma} \bf{Z_i}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ are vectors of the fixed and random effects parameters respectively 
and $\bf{X}$ is the  model matrix representing the overall intercept and effects of the treatment on the number of lesions.
$\bf{Z}$ represents a cell means model matrix for the random intercepts associated with leaves.

```{r exploratory plots}
ggplot(tobacco,aes(x=as.numeric(LEAF),y=NUMBER,))+
  geom_line(aes(linetype=TREATMENT))

ggplot(tobacco, aes(y=NUMBER,x=TREATMENT))+
  geom_point()+facet_grid(~LEAF)

ggplot(tobacco, aes(y=NUMBER,x=TREATMENT))+geom_point()+geom_line(aes(x=as.numeric(TREATMENT)))+facet_grid(~LEAF)

# looking at this graph, LEAF 1,2,3 are all very similar
# baselines are different & slopes differ - magnitude of effect could differ b/w leaves - random intercept random slope model => they all have their own intercept & own slopes it will ultimately only tell us what average intercept & average slope is BUT  it will also record how variable intercepts are & how variable slopes are 
```

# Fit the model
## random intercept model
```{r fit bayesian mixed effects model using gaussian distribution - random intercept fixed slopee, cache=TRUE}
tobacco.form <- bf(NUMBER~(1|LEAF)+TREATMENT,family=gaussian) # intercept can differ for each leaf
tobacco.brms <- brm(tobacco.form,data=tobacco,iter=5000,warmup=2000,thin=5,chains=3,refresh=0) # varying intercept model

# if you get a lot of divergent transitions (i.e. ball rolls off the surface) then you can adjust how much the ball is hit to accept small transitions:
tobacco.brms <- brm(tobacco.form,data=tobacco,iter=5000,warmup=2000,thin=5,chains=3,refresh=0,control=list(adapt_delta=0.99)) # adapt_delta is default set to 0.95 (i.e. reject 5% of step lengths) - by setting it to 0.99 it will only reject 1% of step lengths 

pairs(tobacco.brms) # to identify divergent transitions 
```

# Model validation
## random intercept model
```{r check chain characteristics}
plot(tobacco.brms)                        # check trace plots
mcmc_plot(tobacco.brms,type='acf_bar')    # check autocorrelation
mcmc_plot(tobacco.brms,type='neff_hist')  # check number of effective samples
mcmc_plot(tobacco.brms,type='rhat_hist')  # check chain convergence

# yep looks like sampling is well mixed and chains converged on a stable posterior
```
# Fit model
## random intercept random slope model
```{r fit bayesian mixed effects model using gaussian distribution - random intercept random slope, cache=TRUE}
# we've done the random intercept model, what about a random intercept, random slope model
tobacco.form1 <- bf(NUMBER~(TREATMENT|LEAF)+TREATMENT,family=gaussian)
tobacco.brms1 <- brm(tobacco.form1,data=tobacco,iter=5000,warmup=2000,thin=5,chains=3,refresh=0,control=list(adapt_delta=0.99)) 
# this came out with 2 divergent transitions (divergent transitions are often to do with standard deviation - and so often issues with autocorrelation)
```
# Validate model
## random intercept random slope model
```{r}
plot(tobacco.brms1)                        # check trace plots

mcmc_plot(tobacco.brms1,type='neff_hist')  # check number of effective samples
mcmc_plot(tobacco.brms1,type='rhat_hist')  # check chain convergence

# issues with autocorrelation - can try to deal with this by increasing number of iter, warmup & thinning
```
# Fit model
## random intercept random slope with more iterations etc. etc.
```{r cache=TRUE}
# increase number of iter, warmup, thinning to try get rid of autocorrelation
tobacco.form1 <- bf(NUMBER~(TREATMENT|LEAF)+TREATMENT,family=gaussian)
tobacco.brms2 <- brm(tobacco.form1,data=tobacco,iter=10000,warmup=5000,thin=10,chains=3,refresh=0,control=list(adapt_delta=0.99)) 
```
# Validate model
```{r check chain characteristics}
mcmc_plot(tobacco.brms2,type='acf_bar')    # this is better - not as much autocorrelation
plot(tobacco.brms1)                        # check trace plots
mcmc_plot(tobacco.brms1,type='neff_hist')  # check number of effective samples

```
# Compare models 
```{r LOOIC values}
(l.1 <- loo(tobacco.brms))  # random intercept
(l.1 <- loo(tobacco.brms2)) # random intercept random slope

# ok so the random intercept random slope model isn't actually better so let's just stick with random intercept model
```
# Validate the best model a bit more
## random intercept model
```{r check for overdispersion}

plot(tobacco.resids)
# remember this is a really small dataset so can't worry too much about all the red on the residuals plot

# SIDE NOTE: other than divergent transitions, for any other problems go back to your priors and narrow them a bit to try fix things

# leaf 7 had 4 more lesions than the average baseline - all of those effects sum to zero - sometimes to referred to as sum to zero effects 

```

# Predictions

# what about the probability that the difference b/w strong & weak is more than 50%? i.e. what is the probability of a more than 50% increase from weak to strong?
