# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
starling = read_csv('../data/starling_full.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(starling)
# body mass changes of starlings b/w start (Nov) & end (Jan) of breeding season depending on where they nested (tree, nest-box, inside, other)
# nested design - each bird acts as their own control - blocking design 
# often refer to this as a repeated measures design - assume can't account for time ordering so account for temporal autocorrelation (Bird 1 measured in Nov & Jan, Bird 2 measured in Nov & Jan)

# TREE            NEST BOX       (between block effects)
# BIRD1           BIRD 2
# Nov , Jan       Nov , Jan      (within block effects)

starling <- mutate(starling, MONTH=factor(MONTH, levels=c('Nov','Jan')),SITUATION=factor(SITUATION),BIRD=factor(BIRD))
# perhaps should do Jan before Nov,

# could try  y ~ situation * month + (1 | bird)
# OR try     y ~ situation * month + (month | bird)
# doing   y ~ situation * month + (situation | bird) would not be sensible because situation can't change for each bird
# unit of replication are the birds

# response variable: body mass - integers - normal

# WHAT TO WRITE IN METHODS SECTION OF PAPER:
# the effects of roosting situation on starling mass changes were explored using bayesian hierarchical (mixed effects) modelling
# specifically, the model included effects of roosting situation and month and their interaction, as well as the random effects / varying effects of bird were added to account for the dependency structure ...
# OR: specifically, the model included the multiplicative effects of situation and month, as well as the random effects / varying effects of bird were added to account for the dependency structure 
# each of 3 MCMC chains contained 5000 iterations, with a warmup/burnin of 2000, thinned to a rate of 5
# trace plots and r-hat values (all <1.05) indicated that the chains were well mixed and converged on a stable posterior
# you might say something about planned comparisons - subsequently the pairwise differences between situations were compared from the posterior (i.e. something that indicates that you've done all the pairwise comparisons)
# models were fit using the brms package (i.e. acknowledge what package you used to fit the model & cite it) in the R statistical and graphical environment (cite R)
```

# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
This is where you indicate what the priors were that you were using
the gammaZi refers to the random effects (intercept of each bird & overall intercept - how each bird differs from overall intercept i.e. the average) - these will sum to zero
betas are often for fixed effects, gammas are often for random effects
the gamma = gamma0 is just how you write (1|BIRD)
if random intercept random slope then gamma = gamma0 + zetaXi
and then what's below is specifying the priors - get this from R and enter in 
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i} + \boldsymbol{\gamma} \bf{Z_i}\\
\boldsymbol{\gamma} = \gamma_0\\
\beta_0 \sim{} \mathcal{N}(0, 100)\\
\beta \sim{} \mathcal{N}(0, 10)\\
\gamma_0 \sim{} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_1^2)\\
\sigma \sim{} \mathcal{cauchy}(0, 2)\\
\sigma_1 \sim{} \mathcal{cauchy}(0, 2)\\
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ are vectors of the fixed and random effects parameters respectively 
and $\bf{X}$ is the model matrix representing the overall intercept and effects of roosting situation and month on starling mass.
$\bf{Z}$ represents a cell means model matrix for the random intercepts associated with individual birds.

  geom_point(aes(color=SITUATION))+
  geom_line(aes(x=as.numeric(MONTH)))+
  facet_wrap(~BIRD)

# reef / site / transect (all random effect)
# (Reef/Site) OR (1|Reef)+(1|Site)

# difference b/w inside (higher mass) & other (lower mass) - significant
# difference b/w Jan & Nov significant

# all the conf intervals for the interactions contain zero so doesn't seem to be much of a difference - so could've gotten away with an additive model
```

# Predictions

```{r}
# since there doesn't seem to be an interaction - it'd be good to know the difference b/w months across all situations
emmeans(starling.brms,pairwise~MONTH)
# on average across all situations there's a 9.08g difference b/w Nov & Jan (so they gain 9.08g going from Nov to Jan on average across all situations)

# difference b/w months for each situation
emmeans(starling.brms,pairwise~MONTH|SITUATION)$contrast 
```

```{r}
# what about probabilities??? express effect sizes as percentages:
starling.em <- emmeans(starling.brms,~MONTH|SITUATION) %>% 
  gather_emmeans_draws() %>% 
  spread(key=MONTH,value=.value) %>% 
  mutate(Eff=Jan-Nov,PEff=100*(Jan-Nov)/Nov) %>% ungroup # ungroup in case it's grouping by more than just situation
  
starling.em %>% dplyr::select(SITUATION,Eff,PEff) %>% group_by(SITUATION) %>% summarize(Prob=sum(PEff>10)/n())

# so the probability that there's a more than 10% increase in mass from Nov to Jan is 0.82 for inside, 0.93 for nest-box, 0.75 for other, 0.28 for tree - so fairly significant for inside & nest-box

# IN RESULTS:
# plot showing model differences in mass for each month for each situation: ggemmeans(starling.brms,~SITUATION|MONTH) %>% plot 
# caterpillar plot - difference b/w months for each situation
# would state there was a difference in months for each situation - could quote numbers  e.g. on average across all situations the mass change from Nov to Jan was weight gain by 9.08g - put in conf. credibility intervals too
# or you might be focused on the probabilities 
# i.e. don't necessarily need to put tables in, but you would if you didn't put a caterpillar plot in
```
