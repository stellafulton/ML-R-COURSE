# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(quinn)
summary(quinn)

# declare categorical variables are factors (they are by default read in as characters)
quinn <- quinn %>% mutate(SEASON=factor(SEASON),DENSITY=factor(DENSITY))

# response data is count data so probably Poisson distribution for this one
# categorical predictors so a boxplot would be useful for exploratory analysis
```


	
# Exploratory data analysis
	
Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\[1em]
\end{align}
$$
                                           
where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$
is a model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.

```{r exploratory boxplot}
quinn %>% ggplot(aes(x=SEASON,y=RECRUITS,fill=DENSITY))+ # put the one with the most groups on the x axis & the one wth less groups as the different colours
  geom_boxplot()

# seems here box plot lower down on y axis are smaller so possibly a relatioship b/w mean & variance (this would be a problem for Gaussian, but not a Poisson)

# NB: problem with transforming data - when you predict, low predictions & error bars below zero (square root transformations can be very dangerous because of how the square root function works on pos vs. neg & numbers between 0 and 1 for example) - so DON'T DO THIS!!!!

# plot on transformed axes
quinn %>% ggplot(aes(x=SEASON,y=RECRUITS,fill=DENSITY))+ 
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10()

# a good starting point is Poisson - model we want to fit will have 2 categories & their interactions

```

# Fit the model
```{r fitting}
quinn_glm1 <- glm(RECRUITS~DENSITY*SEASON,data=quinn,family=poisson(link='log')) # DENSITY*SEASON is shorthand for DENSITY + SEASON + DENSITYxSEASON just FYI

```

# Model validation
```{r validation}
autoplot(quinn_glm1,which=1:6)
# residuals plot looks fine
# Q-Q normal plot looks fine
# observation 34 has a large Cook's D so that's a bit of a concern - need to have a look at that (if this was your own data to check why)
```

# Model investigation / hypothesis testing
Goodness of fit
```{r goodness of fit}
1-pchisq(quinn_glm1$deviance,quinn_glm1$df.residual) # this number is really small!! so there is evidence for a lack of fit! oh no!
```
Overdispersion
```{r overdispersion}
quinn_glm1$deviance/quinn_glm1$df.residual # yes, data are overdispersed so there's more variance than expected from a Poisson - hmmm could be something to do with the zeros in our data.... - are there too many??
```
Excessive zeros ?
```{r}
# how many zeros do we have ? compare this with how many we expect to get - ideally we should do this with each population
ggplot(quinn_glm1,aes(x=SEASON,y=RECRUITS,fill=DENSITY))+
  geom_boxplot()

# to calculate proportion of zeros we have relative to how many we expect:
# this calculates how many zeros we have
quinn %>% group_by(SEASON,DENSITY) %>% 
  summarise(Mean=mean(RECRUITS),Zeros=sum(RECRUITS==0),Total=n()) %>% 
  mutate(Prop=Zeros/Total)
# this is how many zeros we expect from Poisson:
sum(rpois(1000000,lambda=2.67)==0)/1000000 # ok so only expect about 7% zeros

# so we have too many zeros in our dataset so we will need to try a Negative Binomial to see if that absorbs the overdispersion - if not, might have to try a zero-inflated model
```
