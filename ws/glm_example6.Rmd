# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(quinn)
summary(quinn)

# declare categorical variables are factors (they are by default read in as characters)
quinn <- quinn %>% mutate(SEASON=factor(SEASON),DENSITY=factor(DENSITY))

# response data is count data so probably Poisson distribution for this one
# categorical predictors so a boxplot would be useful for exploratory analysis
```


	
# Exploratory data analysis
	
Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\[1em]
\end{align}
$$
                                           
where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$
is a model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.

```{r exploratory boxplot}
quinn %>% ggplot(aes(x=SEASON,y=RECRUITS,fill=DENSITY))+ # put the one with the most groups on the x axis & the one wth less groups as the different colours
  geom_boxplot()

# seems here box plot lower down on y axis are smaller so possibly a relatioship b/w mean & variance (this would be a problem for Gaussian, but not a Poisson)

# NB: problem with transforming data - when you predict, low predictions & error bars below zero (square root transformations can be very dangerous because of how the square root function works on pos vs. neg & numbers between 0 and 1 for example) - so DON'T DO THIS!!!!

# plot on transformed axes
quinn %>% ggplot(aes(x=SEASON,y=RECRUITS,fill=DENSITY))+ 
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10()

# a good starting point is Poisson - model we want to fit will have 2 categories & their interactions

```

# Fit the model
```{r fitting}
quinn_glm1 <- glm(RECRUITS~DENSITY*SEASON,data=quinn,family=poisson(link='log')) # DENSITY*SEASON is shorthand for DENSITY + SEASON + DENSITYxSEASON just FYI

```

# Model validation
```{r validation}
autoplot(quinn_glm1,which=1:6)
# residuals plot looks fine
# Q-Q normal plot looks fine
# observation 34 has a large Cook's D so that's a bit of a concern - need to have a look at that (if this was your own data to check why)
```

# Model investigation / hypothesis testing
Goodness of fit
```{r goodness of fit}
1-pchisq(quinn_glm1$deviance,quinn_glm1$df.residual) # this number is really small!! so there is evidence for a lack of fit! oh no!
```
Overdispersion
```{r overdispersion}
quinn_glm1$deviance/quinn_glm1$df.residual # yes, data are overdispersed so there's more variance than expected from a Poisson - hmmm could be something to do with the zeros in our data.... - are there too many??
```
Excessive zeros ?
```{r}
# how many zeros do we have ? compare this with how many we expect to get - ideally we should do this with each population
ggplot(quinn_glm1,aes(x=SEASON,y=RECRUITS,fill=DENSITY))+
  geom_boxplot()

# to calculate proportion of zeros we have relative to how many we expect:
# this calculates how many zeros we have
quinn %>% group_by(SEASON,DENSITY) %>% 
  summarise(Mean=mean(RECRUITS),Zeros=sum(RECRUITS==0),Total=n()) %>% 
  mutate(Prop=Zeros/Total)
# this is how many zeros we expect from Poisson:
sum(rpois(1000000,lambda=2.67)==0)/1000000 # ok so only expect about 7% zeros

# so we have too many zeros in our dataset so we will need to try a Negative Binomial to see if that absorbs the overdispersion - if not, might have to try a zero-inflated model
```
Use DHARMa package to deal with mixed effects models & diagnose zero-inflation
```{r DHARMa package}
# DHARMa package - calculates residuals via simulations - better at diagnosing issues with residuals, autocorrelation & zero-inflation in mixed effects models because of the way it calculates residuals

simulateResiduals <- simulateResiduals(quinn_glm1,plot=TRUE) # simulates residuals & gives you a plot kind of like autoplot

# plot on left is interpreted like a Q-Q normal plot - we want to see a straight line in a Q-Q normal plot - but here we don't have a straight line - implies there's more data towsards the tails than we would have expected - instead of being a genuine Poisson distribution, there's more data at the tails than expected - this is pretty common

# the Q-Q 'like' plot also overlays some tests: in this case the data has failed the dispersion test & the outlier test - so this tells us there's some problems with overdispersion

# graph on the right is a residual plot but instead of being centred on zero, the residuals are scaled 0 to 1 so they are centred around 0.5 - the red stars indicate residuals have maxed out (i.e. as far under or over as they could be - totally outside range of the simulated data) - this is typically a big red flag for zero inflation - here rather than fitting a single line it fits 3 lines ( 1 is through middle of data ( centred around 0.5) & then 1 centred around 25th quantile, & one centred around 75th quantile - this is because there may not be a straight pattern in your residuals it may be different parts of the pattern operate differently i.e. data with low values might be linear, but high values may be non-linear i.e. different patterns in different parts of your data) - sometimes the bottom line might be wiggly & the other 2 aren't if there is zero inflation & the line will be red - BUT in this case, (NB we have purely categorical data) we don't expect wigglyness in the residuals because we have categorical data 

# DHARMa simulated residuals work better as diagnostic tool

```
Dispersion test using simulated residuals
```{r dispersion test}
testDispersion(quinn_glm1) # dispersion test - same as was on previous graph but more info - we can see here our fitted model is wayyyyy outside the simulated range
```
Zero-inflation test using simulated residuals
```{r}
testZeroInflation(quinn_glm1) # this shows evidence of excessive zeros (ideally we would want the red line to overlap with one of the grey bars) - so we could address this problem by running a zero-inflated model, or a negative Binomial which can often deal with this problem so let's try that first
# NB it's not super important know where the zeros are, just that the dataset is zero-inflated
```
# Run negative binomial model to deal with zero inflation
fit model
```{r fit model}
# fit model:
quinn_nb <- glm.nb(RECRUITS~DENSITY*SEASON,data=quinn)
```
Test assumptions
First using autoplot (the residuals that are just distance between observed & expected)
```{r assumptions testing}
# run autoplot to test assumptions:
autoplot(quinn_nb,which=1:6) # these graphs looks pretty ok, there's one observation with a high Cook's D but otherwise things look ok (with small datasets you'll almost always get outliers so sometimes unaviodable)
```
Then using simulated residuals
```{r}
# let's have a look at the DHARMa simulated residuals
simulatedResiduals_nb <- simulateResiduals(quinn_nb,plot=TRUE)
# here the QQ normal plot looks much better than the Poisson & no evidence of overdispersion or outliers based on the tests they run - but still highlighting one value as a red star (probably observation 34) but not considered evidence of zero-inflation - this model is absorbing the excessive zeros 
```
Double check for overdispersion & lack of fit
```{r lack of fit, overdispersion}
# no evidence of a lack of fit & no overdispersion so this model is better than Poisson (let's just double check this for demonstration purposes)

1-pchisq(quinn_nb$deviance,quinn_nb$df.residual) # no evidence of lack of fit

quinn_nb$deviance/quinn_nb$df.residual # no overdispersion
```
Plot effects model of negative model
```{r plot effects model}
plot(allEffects(quinn_nb),multiline=TRUE,ci.style='bar') # multiline means put multiple lines on the 1 graph, and ci.style means put error bars on # NB this is plotted on a log scale

# this plot would also be called an interactions plot - implies we have some idea we know what happens between seasons but that is not true - the lines aren't really appropriate here but they can be useful because if the lines are parallel it usually implies no interaction, if they aren't parallel there is an interaction

# so here it looks like there's an effect of density but depends on the season - so that means there is an interaction between density & season
```
need to be careful with interpreting interactions appropriately depending on the scale
```{r plot effects model on log scale}
plot(allEffects(quinn_nb),multiline=TRUE,ci.style='bar',type='link')
```
# Summary of model
```{r summary working on the link scale (log scale)}
summary(quinn_nb)

# the intercept here represents the AUTUMN high just because it's in alphabetical order
# if the intercept is estimated poorly then everything will be out, because everything is compared to the intercept
# if one of your categories has lower replication than the others then don't let it be the first category - otherwise it will skew all the other estimates of the other categories 

# when you have interactions, first thing is to look at interaction terms (but need to interpet other factors in order to do this) - in the presence of interactions you can't make wild statements about the other factors - to interpret interactions need to interpret the other bits first

# how to interpert interaction terms: we expect gap between low & high density will be same in all seasons, BUT for example here, the low density value in summer is 0.7 units below the low density value in autumn - so in this example it is summer where the gap in high & low density is significant 

```

```{r working on scale of the model - response scale - back transform}
tidy(quinn_nb,conf.int=TRUE,exponentiate=TRUE) # here the numbers are density low is .92 x 19.67 (NOT .92 less then 19.67) 

# here we can say 145% increase in low density in summer compared to low density in autumn (or 1/2.45 = 0.4 = 40% less in autumn than summer)
```
Pair-wise comparison to determine magnitude of effect
```{r}
emmeans(quinn_nb,pairwise~DENSITY|SEASON,type='response') # this enables us to compare density in each seasons & comparisons are going to made on the 'repsonse' scale i.e. natutral scale (NOT the 'link' scale i.e. log scale)

# how to interpret these results:
# in autumn there is no evidence of an effect of density, same with spring (because of their ratios & p values0)
# in summer there is evidence of an effect of density because the high density populations are 120% higher than in low density (ratio = 2.189)

# NB the effect sizes are on the repsonse scale but the p value & z value are performed on log scale
```
Now let's plot:
# Predictions
```{r}
quinn_nb_new <- emmeans(quinn_nb, ~DENSITY|SEASON,type='response') %>% as.data.frame()
head(quinn_nb_new)
```
# Summary figures
```{r}
ggplot(quinn_nb_new,aes(x=SEASON,y=response,fill=DENSITY))+
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin=asymp.LCL,ymax=asymp.UCL),shape=21,position=position_dodge(width=0.2))+
  theme_classic()+annotate(geom='text',x=3,y=68,label='*',size=7) # dodge nudges points to the side so they don't sit on top of each other, annotate adds that little star that we want to indicate signficance - annotate will let you add any sort of arbitrary stuff to the graph
```
