# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(quinn)
summary(quinn)
# multivariate ANOVA
# 2 experimental treatments that were crossed 
# 4 seasons crossed with the 2 densities = 8 parameters (1 is the intercept, the first combination of groups, the others are the slopes and are the main effects & their interactions)
# let's start with a Poisson because we're dealing with counts 
```

```{r dataprep, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = quinn %>% mutate(SEASON = factor(SEASON),
                         DENSITY = factor(DENSITY))
# declare categories as factors
# how about we re-order the seasons:
quinn <- quinn %>% mutate(SEASON=factor(SEASON,levels=c('Summer','Autumn','Winter','Spring')),DENSITY=factor(DENSITY))
levels(quinn$SEASON)

# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{NB}(\lambda_i, \theta)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\
\beta_0 &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(0,10)\\
\beta_{1,2,3} &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(0,2.5)\\
\theta &\sim{} \mathcal{Exp}(1)
\end{align}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$ is a model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.

# Fit the model

# hmm there's some problems here - evidence for overdispersion & some outliers - could  try a Neg Binomial, could try zero inflation model, OR could add an observation level random effect:

# observation level random effect - you add a variable that's numbered from 1 through to the number of observations you've got - it's like a dummy variable

# caveat with adding an observation level random effect: statistical shrinking - estimates tend to get shrunk in towards the mean - adding observation level random effects can increase the amount of shrinkage
```

# Further model validation
```{r plot simulated residuals against individual predictors}
# you should plot residuals against each of your predictors & against any other variables you think might be important perhaps for e.g. time
# so far we've only plotted them against season*density (because that's what we put in the model)

# so let's plot residuals against season, and against density

# you can plot with ggplot without a dataset and instead just calling a vector
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=NULL,aes(y=quinn.resids$scaledResiduals,x=quinn$SEASON)) # plot simulated residuals against SEASON - we want NO PATTERN

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=NULL,aes(y=quinn.resids$scaledResiduals,x=quinn$DENSITY)) # plot simulated residuals against DENSITY

# it is possible for patterns in the individual residual-predictor plots to be masked in the full plot so it is worth looking at these
```
```{r quick look at model plot}
g <- ggpredict(quinn.brmsNB) %>% plot # quick look at ggpredict plot to see what we might expect from our model # these graphs are partial plots - average when holding the reference group constant so the first graph is average number of recruits each season at high density, bottom graph is average number of recruits at each density in summer
do.call('grid.arrange',g) # does a call for each item in list (kind of like a loop) # now we get both graphs

# the following 2 lines of code does exactly the same thing just less elegant
grid.arrange(g[[1]],g[[2]])
grid.arrange(g[['SEASON']],g[['DENSITY']])

```{r indicative plot showing interactions}
ggemmeans(quinn.brmsNB,terms=c('SEASON','DENSITY')) %>% plot

```{r summarise model, let's see if there's any effect}

# autumn has 0.89 lower recruitment than summer 
# winter is 2.15 less than summer
# spring is less than summer too
# low density is lower than high density

# the interaction terms represent how much the difference between low & high density change for each season - based on confidence intervals it seems the difference b/w low & high density in spring is significantly different to the difference b/w low & high density in summer


# this shows some evidence of interactions - remember these numbers are on log scale still
